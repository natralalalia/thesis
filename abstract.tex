%Neuromorphic Engineering
Neuromorphic engineering uses analogue, digital, and mixed-mode VLSI and software systems to mimic the biological neural architectures. 
It has been a hot area of research in recent years, since the start of searching alternative computer architectures other than Von Neumann.
Human brain, as a computing system, couples the computation and the memory closely together on the neurons and the connections between them.
Thus the biological neural architecture intrinsically solves the problem of computation-memory bottleneck.
Moreover the brain wins over its artificial counterpart, the computer, on intelligent processing tasks, but using much lower computing frequency, slower communication and efficient power usage.
Neuromorphic engineering aims to unveil the mystery of the brain approaches and also to build brain-inspired computing system.
 
%Spiking Neural Networks as a tool [wiki]
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) fall into the third generation of neural network models, increasing the level of realism in a neural simulation.
In addition to neuronal and synaptic state, SNNs also incorporate the concept of time into their operating model.
%maybe a bit more about what is spiking neuron...
%tool for NE
SNNs work as a simulating tool for neuromorphic engineering, where applications can operate.

%Neuromorphic Vision
The study on computer vision has been active for several decades, while neuromorphic vision is still in its infancy.
Although SNNs have been verified the equal capabilities of EM, and etc., there is no direct transformation from conventional methods to SNNs due to the significant different operating mechanism.
Various coding methods exist for interpreting the outgoing spike train as a real-value number, either relying on the frequency of spikes, or the timing between spikes, to encode information. %wiki
Comparing to computer vision, Neuromorphic vision differentiate in the input, processing of data, and learning algorithms.
The biological-inspired vision sensors provide a main source of input data, and have been on commercial shelves after decades of research.
Data processing and learning algorithms on SNNs are still in the initial stages.

%Object Recognition application
This thesis uses object recognition as a cut-in point to explore the Neuromorphic Vision.
SNN models and learning algorithms have been proposed the studied in the thesis.
