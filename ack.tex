First and foremost I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my supervisor, Prof. Steve Furber, for all his contributions of time, patience and funding to my study.
%It has been a great honour to be his student, and my study has been such a unique experience.
I am grateful for his `ease-the-grip' strategy that I have complete freedom to explore my own research problems and find out answers and solutions to them.
Although sometimes problems occur and tough time comes, he tells and encourages me, persistence is the key to all the problems.
It builds up my confidence to think and act professionally like a scientist.
At the same time, he knows when to `hold hands firmly' that the thesis would not be finished without his kind reminds about commitment on writing.

I would like to thank my colleges Dr. John Woods, Dr. Cameron Patterson, Prof. Yunhua Chen, Garibaldi Pineda Garcia, Jonathan Heathcote and Robert James, for their collaborations, meaningful discussions, insightful comments and helpful English revision on my papers and thesis.
Those sleepless nights we work towards deadlines, and densely packed corrections in various colour written on my printed papers, will stay in my memory.

In addition, I express my gratitude to Dr. Jim Garside, Mireya Paredes Lopez, Crefeda Rodrigues, Athanasios Stratikopoulos, and Geoffrey Ndu for being my great companion and friends.

My sincere thanks to my parents and beloved husband, Xuekai Li for supporting and understanding me spiritually throughout my life in general.
